# 🧍‍♂️ Biography


I am currently a M.S. student with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acvlab/">Advanced Computer Vision Laboratory (ACVLAB)</a> at the Institute of Data Science, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan. I am a passionate computer vision and deep learning researcher. I am fortunate to be advised by and work with Prof. <a href="https://cchsu.info/">Chih-Chung Hsu</a> (NCKU),  Prof. <a href="https://www.albany.edu/faculty/mchang2/">Ming-Ching Chang</a> (SUNY) and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gMBvzGoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)">Xin Li</a> (SUNY). I have participated several projects which are related to CV/DL during my master program.

I received a B.S. degree at the Department of Statistics and Information Science, Fu Jen Catholic University (FJCU), Taiwan, in 2023. I was advised by Prof. Hao-Chiang Shao.

My research interests include: 

- **Computer Vision (Mainly focus on Low-level Vision)**
- **Image/Video Processing and Hyperspectral Image**
- **Data-Efficient Learning and Deep/Machine Learning**
  
I am also exploring other computer vision-related fields which are interested to me, such as Multi-Object Tracking, 3D-scene Reconstruction. I am actively seeking a collaboration. 

In addition, I also enjoy fishing🐬, boxing🥊, cooking🍲, baking🍞 and traveling🌐, welcome to talk about that with me if you have the same hobbyXD.
