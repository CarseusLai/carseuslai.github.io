<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2022. I am currently working toward an M.S. degree in Information and Telecommunication Engineering at the School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China.

My research interests include **physics-informed machine learning**, **reliability engineering**, and **condition monitoring**.
