# 🧍‍♂️ Biography


I am currently a M.S. student with the Advanced Computer Vision Laboratory (ACVLAB) at the Institute of Data Science, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan. I fortunately am working with Prof. Chih-Chung Hsu. I have participated several projects which are related to CV/DL during my master program.

I received his B.S. degree at the Department of Statistics and Information Science, Fu Jen Catholic University (FJCU), Taiwan, in 2023. I worked with Prof. Hao-Chiang Shao.

My research interests include 
- **Image/Video Processing and Data-Efficient Learning**
- **Computer Vision (Mainly focus on Low-level Vision)**
- **Hyperspectral Image and Deep/Machine Learning**
